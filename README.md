# Android_Coroutine_Flow_Sample
Sample Android app to get github repositories by passing username using Android kotlin, Coroutine, Flow, Hilt and MVVM Clean Architecture 

I have created the project in MVVM Clean Architecture to utilise best industry practices and to test the module easily.

Hilt is used for Dependency injection and to provide the dependencies wherever needed and avoid concrete dependency creation.

Coroutine and Flow has been used to implement asynchronous programming.

This main branch contains View implementation. check out another branch for compose UI

I have used Dependency version Catalog Manager to maintain the gradle dependencies. All dependencies are present in libs.versions.toml under gradle.
